It does not feel right to tell my little boy about all the atrocities that has happened because of the race, gender, ethnicity, <em>et cetera</em>.\nI wish that poor innocent soul would never have to learn about it.  But I do not want him to be unaware of the past.  One day or the other, he would come to know about it.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You might never be ready for that day, but one day, you would have to speak to your child about the various forms of discrimination.  You would hesitate: the child is too innocent to learn about hatred that has tormented us.  \"Maybe not today.  Let him not know about the bias now.\"  But you can't delay it forever.  It would be better if you taught your child about the transgressions like racial discrimination before the child experiences it for themselves.</p>\n<p>You fear that after telling that innocent kid, you would be staining them, contaminating their minds, and then they would start noticing colours.  You would hope that they understand it, but for someone who has never been wicked, how would that clean kid possibly understand what you are trying to say?  They would not be able to parse the fact that at one point of time in history, people treated oppressing others was fine.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Q. I wonder what is the best way to tell a kid about the cruelties like oppression, racial discrimination, gender-based discrimination, ethnic cleansing, xenophobia or any form of bias?  How would you even tell about the cultural differences?</p>\n<p>Q. I wonder how old was I, when I first noticed bias, oppression and siblings of such heinous deeds?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I would strongly suggest you listening to <em>You've Got to Be Carefully Taught</em>, a 1949-song composed by Richard Rodgers, and lyrics Oscar Hammerstein II for <em>South Pacific</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6aXgSsCmhk4Dl9mURJ06pY?si=uQ7M8dxZQ8mmwNFWVGVXgA\">Link</a> to the song on Spotify, or listen here:</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A6aXgSsCmhk4Dl9mURJ06pY\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n<figcaption><em>\"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\" (1949) by Richard Rodgers, \"South Pacific\"</em></figcaption>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"title":"Teaching about 'hatred'"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"author":"@SanaHabeeb4","cover":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1503525148566-ef5c2b9c93bd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","date":"2018-12-04","description":"Hi,  I am Sanā!","name":"Sanā Habeeb","next":{"frontmatter":{"cover":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526367790999-0150786686a2","date":"2019-08-08","excerpt":"I can't justify someone's request to not have a particular person as the SPL because she is of a particular religion.
